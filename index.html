        <h1>Scrabble Solver</h1>

<p>This is a command line Scrabble solver written in Ruby. Its purpose is to find
all of the possible words given a set of tiles and some optional arguments.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Dead simple. you need to have Ruby &gt;= 1.9.2 installed on your system and then just
execute:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install scrabble-solver
</code></pre>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<h2>Basic</h2>

<p>Let's start with the basics, a simple set of tiles:</p>

<pre><code>$ scrabble-solver tehre
</code></pre>

<p>This will return a list of words, among them will be "there", "three", "thee"
and so on.</p>

<h2>Controlling length</h2>

<p>If you only want words that are longer than 5 letters returned, that's easy:</p>

<pre><code>$ scrabble-solver tehre --longer-than 5
</code></pre>

<p>If you only want words that are <em>shorter</em> than 4 letters, that's easy too:</p>

<pre><code>$ scrabble-solver tehre --shorter-than 4
</code></pre>

<p>You can, of course, combine these if you want:</p>

<pre><code>$ scrabble-solver tehre --shorter-than 6 --longer-than 3
</code></pre>

<h2>Filtering by starts-with and ends-with</h2>

<p>This is pretty self explanatory. If you only want words that start with "th",
you would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ scrabble-solver tehre --starts-with th
</code></pre>

<p>And the same goes for ends-with:</p>

<pre><code>$ scrabble-solver tehre --ends-with re
</code></pre>

<h2>Blank tiles (wildcards)</h2>

<p>Got a blank tile? No problem!</p>

<pre><code>$ scrabble-solver "tehre?"
</code></pre>

<p>You need to wrap the tiles you have in double quotes, otherwise the terminal
will shout at you. It doesn't matter where you put the question mark(s), they
will register fine wherever you put them and you can have as many as you want.</p>

<h2>Being specific</h2>

<p>Say you've got a really sweet triple letter lined up that will only work if
your Z is the first letter in the word, check this out:</p>

<pre><code>$ scrabble-solver zloogsti --contains z --at 1
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use wildcards in the <code>--contains</code> flag:</p>

<pre><code>$ scrabble-solver zloogsti --contains z?o --at 1
</code></pre>

<p>This will match z, anything, o and then anything after that. So "zoo"
will match beautifully.</p>

<p>If you don't feel like specifying an <code>--at</code> flag, you don't have to.
This will return "zoology" just fine:</p>

<pre><code>$ scrabble-solver zlogoyo --contains gy
</code></pre>

<h1>Word lists</h1>

<p>This current version uses the standard Unix word list, but it is designed in
such a way that you can use whatever word list you please.</p>

<p>To specify a new word file, you would do the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ scrabble-solver letters --word-file /path/to/new/word/file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The word file needs to be a file that contains a list of words, one word per
line. The words can be whatever you want, the solver really doesn't care.</p>
